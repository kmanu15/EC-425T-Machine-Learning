# EC 425: Machine-Learning
This repository showcases my final project, which I completed for EC 425: Machine Learning. I took this class in Winter 2025 at UCLA.

## ðŸ“„ Project
- [Final Project](https://github.com/kmanu15/EC-425T-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Final%20Project.pdf) - Completed project presentation 

## ðŸ’° Predicting Credit Default
-	Developed various models to predict credit default risk using a Kaggle Credit Risk dataset
-	Cleaned data by handling missing values and outliers, and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables
-	Fit and compared logistic regression, basic decision tree, and cost-complexity pruned decision tree models
-	Evaluated model performance, finding logistic regression achieved 86.7% accuracy, the basic decision tree improved recall for defaults (76%), and the pruned decision tree had the highest overall accuracy at 92.7%
-	Presented insights on recall/precision tradeoffs depending on risk minimization or profit maximization goals

## ðŸ’» Code
- [final_project.ipynb](https://github.com/kmanu15/EC-425T-Machine-Learning/blob/main/final_project.ipynb): Code where I processed the data and built and reviewed the models

## ðŸ“Š Data
For this project, I used a [Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data) from Kaggle
