# EC 425: Machine-Learning
This repository showcases my final project, which I completed for EC 425: Machine Learning. I took this class in Winter 2025 at UCLA.

## ðŸ“„ Project
- [Final Project](https://github.com/kmanu15/EC-425T-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Final%20Project.pdf) - Completed project presentation 

## ðŸ’° Predicting Credit Default
- Developed machine learning models to predict credit default risk using the Kaggle Credit Risk dataset.
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- Implemented and compared models, including logistic regression, a basic decision tree, and a cost-complexity pruned decision tree.
- Evaluated model performance, finding logistic regression achieved 86.7% accuracy, the basic decision tree improved recall for defaults (76%), and the pruned decision tree reached the highest overall accuracy (92.7%).
- Provided lender-oriented insights, showing tradeoffs between recall and precision depending on whether the objective is risk minimization or profit maximization.

## ðŸ’» Code

## ðŸ“Š Data
For this project, I used a [Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data) from Kaggle
